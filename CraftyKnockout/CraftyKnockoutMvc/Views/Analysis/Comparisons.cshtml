<h3>Knockout vs VanilliaJS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You could indeed write you own data dinging library, but whty would you when there are projects out there that do it for you?</li>
    <li>Knockout does not mandate or rely on any other *JS libraries, not even JQuery. So if you need data-binding you can use knockout and code the rest yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Knockout vs AngluarJS/EmberJs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Knockout is not intending to be a UI building framework. As described by John Papa on his blog it is not a fair comparison.
        Knockout is a binding library, and only intends to be so. Angular is a full application framework. Anglular does indeed have its own
        data binding syntax.
